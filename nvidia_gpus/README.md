# GPU Analysis
Currently, not very well organized 

gpu\_profile.py	- Needs to be run in cell\_cuda - runs application in background and runs nvidia-smi calls to acquire power, memory, and clock data

## Folders
* cell\_cuda - Particle in cell cuda code 
* gpu\_analysis	- Current simple configuration data from v100 and p100 Nvidia GPU's

## Files
* set.env - Environment for JLSE machine - To Run: source set.env
